The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! You can't use `\relax' after \the.

I'm forgetting what you said and using zero instead.

I suspect you have forgotten a `}', causing me

I'll try to recover; but if the error is serious,
you'd better type `E' or `X' now and fix your file.
